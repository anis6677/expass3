ekspass 3

Task 3 was more difficult.Keeping the entire structure of the project is a big challenge
at the same time when you go in and out and keep a common thread. in the prompt had and small challenges,
but with the help of lectures.  They are very useful and well written. Using Node.js version with IntelliJ IDEA
was useful and because updated all the tools that required the task.

was difficult and manually navigating the application, specifying the position, 
creating several lists. The errors showed errors in npm .at the same time error that the javascript 
module server did not respond with MIMe type text/html. 
using page reddit fixed the problems. Greetings Anita
